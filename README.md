## Introduction

FreeRTOS is a widely used real-time operating system for embedded systems, offering multitasking capabilities to applications. This project showcases how to set up a basic FreeRTOS environment within the STM32CubeIDE, enabling developers to create responsive and efficient embedded applications.

## Features

- **FreeRTOS Integration**: Configured FreeRTOS kernel for task management.
- **STM32CubeIDE Compatibility**: Ready-to-build projects tailored for STM32 microcontrollers.
- **Sample Tasks**: Includes example tasks demonstrating task creation, scheduling, and inter-task communication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **STM32CubeIDE**: Ensure you have the latest version installed. Download it from the [STMicroelectronics website](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html).
- **STM32 Development Board**: A compatible STM32 board (e.g., STM32F4, STM32F7 series).
